# Test Notes - Automatic Fan Control using Arduino

Date: April 7, 2025
Project: Automatic Fan Control with LM35
Tested By: Damaraparapu Anideep

-------------------------------
# Hardware Test Checklist:
-------------------------------

[✓] Arduino Uno connected properly
[✓] LM35 sensor gives correct voltage output
[✓] Fan connected to transistor via PWM pin (D9)
[✓] Flyback diode protects transistor from back EMF
[✓] Serial Monitor outputs temperature values

-------------------------------
# Test Results:
-------------------------------

- Temp = 24.5°C → Fan OFF 
- Temp = 27.2°C → Fan at medium speed (PWM = 128) 
- Temp = 32.6°C → Fan at full speed (PWM = 255) 

-------------------------------
# Observations & Debug Notes:
-------------------------------

- Initial fan didn't spin at medium PWM (solved by using 12V fan with external power)
- Temperature readings were stable and accurate (±0.5°C)
- Serial output helped with real-time debugging

-------------------------------
# Final Verdict:
-------------------------------

# All tests passed. System behaves as expected.
